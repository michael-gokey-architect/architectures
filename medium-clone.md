### Software architecture
Medium's initial technology stack relied on a variety of AWS services including EC2, S3, and CloudFront. 
Originally, it was written in Node.js and the text editor that Medium users wrote blog posts with was based on TinyMCE. 
As of 2017, the blogging platform's technology stack included AWS services, including EBS, RDS for Aurora, and Route 53; 
its image server was written in Go; and the main app servers were still written in Node.
